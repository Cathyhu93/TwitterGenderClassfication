# CIS519TwitterGender

This project is for the kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-user-gender-classification

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not ask users to specify their gender. Our goal in this project is to find out the difficulty of training a model to predict a person’s gender based on their Twitter profile and random tweets. It’s wide applied in personalizing user experience, advertising and public relation management.
